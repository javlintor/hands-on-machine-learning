# Introduction to Artifitial Networks

## ANN (Artifitial Neural Networks)
Artifitial Neural Networds are very simple models that allow us to performe simple calculations based on a set of input parameters. You can construct any logic unit you can imagine, take for example a neuron which is activated when two or more inputs are active. To create a logical OR, connect two inputs A and B to and output C only with one connection. 

## TLU (Therhold Logic Unit)
It is a slighly different version of a ANN, where the inputs are numbers and the output is calculated via the composition of a weighted sum and a step function, for example heaviside or sgn.
